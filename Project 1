[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- A list of personal digital devices (e.g., laptop, smartphone)
- Access to personal online accounts (e.g., email, social media)
- Basic cybersecurity resources or guidelines (which can be found online, such as from the National Cybersecurity Alliance or similar organizations)

## Steps
1) Inventory of Digital Assets: List all your digital devices and online accounts. This includes laptops, smartphones, tablets, and any other internet-connected devices, as well as email accounts, social media, banking, and shopping accounts.
2) Password Audit: Check the strength of passwords for all listed accounts using guidelines for strong passwords (e.g., length, complexity). Identify any accounts with reused or weak passwords. Use a reputable online password strength checker if necessary.
3) Update and Patch: Verify that all your digital devices are running the latest operating system and application versions. List any devices or applications that are outdated and need updates.
4) Implement Improvements: For weak or reused passwords, create and apply new, strong, unique passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager to help manage these passwords securely. Update and patch outdated devices and applications to their latest versions to ensure they have the most current security fixes.
5) Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Identify which of your accounts support two-factor authentication (2FA) and enable it wherever possible. This adds an additional layer of security beyond just the password.
6) Educate Yourself on Phishing: Research and summarize key indicators of phishing attempts. Learn how to identify suspicious emails, links, and phone calls.
7) Device Security Check: Ensure that all devices have a form of lock (PIN, password, biometric) enabled. Check that your devices have firewall and antivirus/anti-malware software installed and activated.
8) Privacy Settings Review: Review and adjust the privacy settings on your social media and other online accounts to enhance your privacy and limit data sharing.
9) Reporting: Draft a report documenting your findings from each step, the improvements you implemented, and any additional steps you plan to take in the future to maintain your cybersecurity posture.
